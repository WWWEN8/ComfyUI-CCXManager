  <p><strong>SD-PPP Plugin Update Assistant - Automatically manages Photoshop-side plugin updates</strong></p>
</div>

CCXManage is an auxiliary node specifically developed for the SD-PPP plugin.

Users who have previously used the SD-PPP node found it very troublesome. When the ComfyUI side of the SD-PPP node was upgraded, the Photoshop side required a more complex manual installation of the plugin, causing the SD-PPP to not be able to use the latest features of the Photoshop-side plugin in a timely manner, resulting in a poor experience. Especially since the SD-PPP node is updated at a very high frequency, because the SD-PPP node developers, in order to better improve the node, receive feedback on BUGs or suggested features from the community and group testers, and they work hard to fix BUGs or update features at the first opportunity. A big thumbs up to the SD-PPP node developers!!!
